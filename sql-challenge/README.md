# sql-challenge
module9

For this poroject, six excel files were studied and an ERD was created in order to connect the CSV files through primary and foreign keys. The downloaded image of the ERD will be found in the "EmployeeSQL" folder under "QuickDBD-export.png". The code to create the ERD was exported into VSCode and will be found under "schemata.sql" inside of the "EmployeeSQL" folder. The file under the name "module9.sql" holds the code for the queries.

I would like to give credit to my sister, Carolina Ulloa, who guided me throughout the course of this module, as well as my professor as he provided me with helpful information that I could refer back to.
